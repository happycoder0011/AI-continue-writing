- Error handling and user-friendly messages
- API key validation
- Fully documented with examples

### 3. **Editor Component** (`src/components/Editor.jsx`)
- ProseMirror rich text editor
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Space for AI, Ctrl+Z for undo)
- AI content highlighting
- Disabled state during generation
- Comprehensive comments explaining React hooks and ProseMirror

### 4. **Toolbar Component** (`src/components/Toolbar.jsx`)
- "Continue Writing" button with Radix UI
- Loading states and error handling
- Keyboard shortcut hints
- Platform-specific shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl)

### 5. **StatusBar Component** (`src/components/StatusBar.jsx`)
- Real-time state indicators
- Color-coded badges (green/yellow/blue/red)
- Word count display
- Error messages

### 6. **AIToolbar Component** (`src/components/AIToolbar.jsx`)
- Floating action toolbar
- Accept/Clear/Discard buttons
- Only appears in review state
- Smooth animations

### 7. **Main App** (`src/App.jsx`)
- Coordinates all components
- Manages state machine
- Radix UI Theme provider
- Complete event handling

## 📦 Dependencies Installed

All required packages are installed:
- React 18.2.0
- XState 5.0.0
- ProseMirror (state, view, model, keymap, history)
- Radix UI (themes, icons)
- OpenAI API client

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 2. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will start at: http://localhost:5173

### 3. Test the Application

1. **Type some text** in the editor
2. **Click "Continue Writing"** or press `Ctrl+Space` (or `Cmd+Space` on Mac)
3. **Wait for AI** to generate content (highlighted in blue)
4. **Choose an action**:
   - Accept All: Keep the AI content
   - Clear All: Remove the AI content
   - Discard Session: Revert to before AI generation

## 📚 Learning Resources

### Documentation Files Created

1. **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Detailed explanation of architecture, concepts, and patterns
3. **product_requirement_spec.md** - Complete product requirements

### Code Comments

Every file includes extensive comments explaining:
- What each function does
- Why certain approaches were chosen
- How components interact
- React and JavaScript concepts for beginners

### Key Files to Study

Start with these files in order:

1. `src/machines/editorMachine.js` - Understand state management
2. `src/App.jsx` - See how components connect
3. `src/components/Editor.jsx` - Learn ProseMirror basics
4. `src/services/aiService.js` - Understand API integration

## 🎯 Features Implemented

✅ AI-powered text continuation
✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Space, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
✅ Rich text editing with ProseMirror
✅ State management with XState
✅ Content management (Accept/Clear/Discard)
✅ Visual feedback (loading, highlighting, status)
✅ Error handling
✅ Responsive design
✅ Accessible UI with Radix
✅ Comprehensive code comments

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Make sure `.env` file is in project root
- Restart dev server after adding API key
- Check that key starts with `sk-`

### Build Errors
- Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if dependency issues
- Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

### Editor Not Showing
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all files are saved
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## 📖 Understanding the Code

### State Machine Flow

```
User Action → Event → State Machine → New State → UI Update
```

Example:
```
Click "Continue" → CONTINUE_CLICK → generating → isGenerating=true → Editor disabled
```

### Component Hierarchy

```
App (state machine)
├── Toolbar (triggers AI)
├── Editor (text editing)
├── AIToolbar (review actions)
└── StatusBar (state display)
```

### Data Flow

```
User types → Editor → App → State Machine → Context updated → StatusBar shows word count
```

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

Try these modifications to learn:

1. **Change AI Model**: In `aiService.js`, change `model: 'gpt-4'` to `'gpt-3.5-turbo'`
2. **Adjust Temperature**: Change `temperature: 0.7` to make AI more/less creative
3. **Add Formatting**: Add bold/italic buttons to Toolbar
4. **Change Colors**: Modify Radix theme in `App.jsx`
5. **Add Sounds**: Play sound when AI finishes generating

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- API key stored in frontend (use backend in production)
- No offline mode yet (transformers.js not implemented)
- Single user only (no collaboration)
- No export feature yet

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

See README.md for full list of planned features:
- Local AI fallback
- Multiple AI models
- Export to Markdown/PDF
- Dark mode
- Collaborative editing

## 💡 Tips for Learning

1. **Read comments first** - Every file has detailed explanations
2. **Use React DevTools** - Install browser extension to inspect components
3. **Console.log everything** - Add logs to understand data flow
4. **Break things** - Modify code and see what happens
5. **Read docs** - Links provided in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
